  description: "We are two brothers that play games together since Super Nintendo and Playstation 1 & 2 eras. We played Megaman X series, Castlevania Sotn, Super Metroid, Aero Fighters, Guitar Hero and other classics all day at the time! After a few years working as web programmer and web designer, we decided to start making the games in the style we love playing: challenging and fun!"
